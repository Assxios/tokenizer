Firstly, create a new [Metamask](https://metamask.io) account and switch to the `Sepolia` test network:
![network](/documentation/imgs/network.png)
> As you can see you will have to check the `Show test networks` option in the settings of Metamask to see the `Sepolia` network.

Then, once you are on the `Sepolia` network, you will notice that you do not have any `SepoliaETH` in your account. To get some, you will have to go to the [Sepolia faucet](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de) and enter your address, which will start mining `SepoliaETH` for you. Once you have mined enough, claim your rewards and you will have `SepoliaETH` in your account. Such as:
![account](/documentation/imgs/account.png)

Then, simply import the contract address `0xD0282c45CeC4f69E9e1D822EBe10754D008df423` into Metamask, using the `Import Account` option. Once you have entered the address, the symbol should appear as `DT42`:
![import](/documentation/imgs/import.png)

If you have done everything correctly, you should see the `DT42` token in your Metamask account:
![success](/documentation/imgs/success.png)

And that's it! You can now send and receive `DT42` tokens!
